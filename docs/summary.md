The game field is represented by a set of **blue** cells. Above them, there is the second layer of **green** cells. The player can control this group â€” move, rotate, and put it with the blue cells (only on the free spaces). After merging, the cells evolve according to the rules of the ["Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) game for one generation, then new green cells are created. The player's goal is to minimize the amount of blue cells.
