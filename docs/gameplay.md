## A Description of Game Fields

The game has two fields: **the primary one** and **the movable part**.

The primary field is represented by a set of **blue** cells. A player can not control the state of this field directly.

The movable part is represented by a set of **green** cells surrounded by a yellow frame. This field locates above the primary one and partially overlaps it. A player can control the position and orientation of this field. An initial position is **an upper left corner**.

At beginning of the game, both fields are filled with **a certain number** of cells **located randomly**.
